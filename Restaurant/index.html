        <h1>Bio - GO SUSHI was born out of our desire to make good, healthy food accessible to everyone, and to break the cycle of diet related diseases in our families and community. We started our journey in February 2012 with a meal delivery and catering company which served the greater Downtown Detroit area. The response was overwhelming! </h1>

            Our mission is to help people live healthier lives by providing great-tasting, high-quality, nutritious vegan food that appeals to everyone, while at the same time doing our part to support a sustainable earth. We partner with local food providers such as The Brinery, Earthworks, Keep Growing Detroit and D Town farms â€“ they provide our seasonal organic produce and we give them our food waste for composting to help them fertilize their farm.
